```

**What it does:**
- 🕵️ Probes API endpoints using curated OWASP/PortSwigger-inspired wordlists
- 📖 Discovers additional routes by parsing live OpenAPI/Swagger/ReDoc documentation
- 🧪 Tests HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS) per endpoint
- 🔍 Performs lightweight parameter probing (query params & JSON body fields)
- 🤖 Optionally generates an **AI-powered pentest risk summary** via OpenAI
- 🎨 Colorized output: green (2xx), yellow (401/403), red (other discovered)

> Research into AV/EDR detection mechanisms and evasion techniques, for defensive understanding and authorized red team assessments.

### 🪝 [DetoursHooker — API Hooking with Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/leedale1981/infosec/tree/master/Antivirus/evasion-techniques/hooking/hooker)

A C++ implementation using [Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) to demonstrate API function hooking — redirecting Windows API calls at the IAT level. Includes a `DetoursSimulator` for safe testing of hooking behavior without live payloads.

---

### 🔗 [HookChain — Indirect Syscall EDR Bypass Research](https://github.com/leedale1981/infosec/tree/master/Antivirus/evasion-techniques/hooking/indirect_syscalls/hookchain)

An implementation of the **HookChain** technique as described in the academic paper *"HookChain: A new perspective for Bypassing EDR Solutions"* (Carvalho Junior, 2024).

**Technique overview:**
- 🔗 **IAT Hooking** — redirects execution at the Import Address Table level
- 🔢 **Dynamic SSN Resolution** — resolves System Service Numbers at runtime to avoid static signatures
- 📞 **Indirect System Calls** — bypasses EDR hooks placed on `Ntdll.dll` by calling the kernel directly

Includes enumeration results (`hookchain_finder64`) against major EDR vendors including CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Defender ATP, Carbon Black, Cortex XDR, and more.

> 📄 White paper: [English v1.5](Antivirus/evasion-techniques/hooking/indirect_syscalls/hookchain/HookChain_en_v1.5.pdf)

A **Go** program demonstrating RSA key pair generation, message encryption/decryption, and classical RSA key factorization attack simulation — illustrating why large key sizes matter and why RSA is vulnerable to quantum computers running Shor's algorithm.

```
Sender  ──[encrypt with public key]──► Ciphertext ──► Receiver (decrypts)
                                            │
